abstract = {In Montana, a rabbi is an unusual sight. So when a Hasidic one walked into the State Capitol last December, with his long beard, black hat and long black coat, a police officer grabbed his bomb-sniffing German shepherd and went to ask the exotic visitor a few questions. Though there are few Jews in Montana today, there once were many. In the late 19th century, there were thriving Jewish populations in the mining towns, where Jews emigrated to work as butchers, clothiers, jewelers, tailors and the like. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

Through this longitudinal research we examine, using a strengths perspective and qualitative interviews, the strategies social workers in 22 hospitals across Ontario, Canada, utilized to survive and thrive. The findings identify the importance of clearly articulating one's value to the organization, staying current, and being flexible. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {This qualitative study explored the factors that help counsellors exposed to indirect trauma thrive personally and professionally, and sustain their engagement in trauma counselling work. The existing literature details the challenges of indirect trauma exposure in trauma work. However, the ways in which counsellors are able to derive rewards and maintain their engagement in trauma counselling work are less well recognised. The study used a grounded theory approach, with semistructured interviews conducted with 18 therapists. The study found four main interrelating themes: thriving in trauma work; navigating the empathic journey; empathic stamina and engaging in self-reflexivity; and sustaining interest and commitment. Important factors included attending to both the adverse and rewarding aspects of trauma work, having access to appropriate support structures, and incorporating variability and diversity in the work. This study extends the current understanding of the processes, practices, and strategies that promote the rewarding and sustaining aspects of trauma counselling work. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

abstract = {Conference Photo The contribution that a Physicist can make to Tribology will be greatly increased by effective and enlightened collaboration with the chemist, metallurgist and engineer. David Tabor (1913-2005) The first meeting of the Institute of Physics Tribology Group was held at Cranfield, UK, in 1980 entitled ''Tribology: Contrasts in Frictional Processes''. The first chair of the Group was David Tabor who subsequently edited the proceedings of the 10th anniversary celebration of the formation of the Group which was held in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1991 and published by this journal as a special issue in 1992. This Special Cluster celebrates the continuation of this thriving Group and the work of some of our leading tribologists in the area who have contributed to the Group meetings in recent years. In particular, we are greatly pleased to have papers from young researchers in the field who will take this subject forward in different directions in the coming decades. In 2000, due to popular demand, the Tribology Group was active in securing the reprint of Tabor''s book The Hardness of Metals, originally published by Clarendon Press in 1951, and a very special memory for the Group was his presence at a one day event at Robinson College in Cambridge in July 2000 where, with characteristic humility and warmth, he asked the Tribology Group members present on the day to sign the blank page at the front of the book as his special memento of the event. He also gave a very illuminating account of his early research career. A tribute to David Tabor, who passed away in November 2005, was given in the opening address of the 25th anniversary meeting by Brian Briscoe, who described the importance of his seminal contributions to the subject which laid the foundation stones in our understanding of contact between solids, friction of metals and non-metals, frictional temperature rise, boundary lubrication and the science of adhesion and sliding wear. Today, 25 years on, tribology, as Tabor anticipated above, is a very different subject, now with significant current interest in contact mechanics at the nano level and the interaction with corrosion and other chemical environments. The 25th anniversary meeting held in February 2006 included presentations in these areas, marking the milestones in the scientific developments in tribology during the past 25 years and was followed by a celebratory dinner in the headquarters of the Institute of Physics at Portland Place in London. Thus, the papers in this Special Cluster of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics celebrate the interdisciplinarity in the subject and some new horizons, authored by individuals who have contributed to IOP Tribology Group meetings in recent years. We are very grateful to the organizers of the 25th anniversary meeting, Mark Rainforth and Philip Shipway, and to the Institute of Physics for sponsorship of the reception on the day. We look forward to this subject moving in diverse directions in the coming years, and to the continuation of our lively and entertaining one day meeting series, where through ''human tribology'', i.e. friction through debate and argument with some of our colleagues, tempered by the lubricating good humour of other colleagues, we progress this subject forward.

abstract = {The positive impact of psychotherapy upon the mental health problems of older people is increasingly accepted. However little attention has been paid to the role of hope in working therapeutically with older adults. Three relevant bodies of literature, namely adult psychotherapy, hope in older adulthood, and coping with chronic and terminal illness, provide a starting point for examining the therapeutic uses of hope. However, it is argued that these literatures cannot provide a sufficiently comprehensive conceptualisation of hope in psychotherapy with elders. Firstly, it is considered that hope in therapy is directly affected by key experiences of ageing, namely: facing physical and/or cognitive deterioration and facing death. Also, these three bodies of literature have tended to dichotomise hope as either beneficial and adaptive or dysfunctional and maladaptive. A developmental perspective is used to critique this dichotomy and a clinical framework is provided which examines the role and utility of hope in older adult psychotherapy from a more integrated viewpoint embedded in the client's life history. The framework is comprised of three types of 'hope work': 'facilitating realistic hope,' 'the work of despair' and 'surviving not thriving'. Suggestions are made about how this work may be carried out and with whom. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {This second of three reviews of action-orientated research in social geography focuses on one area of this work which is thriving. Moving, like many good ideas, from the field conventionally viewed as 'development' to wider application, participatory research (PR) has seen rapid expansion in recent years (see Breitbart, 2003; Kesby et al., 2004; Pratt, 2000). It has particular attractions for social geographers, who are beginning to contribute to wider debates and critiques around its philosophies, theories and practices. They face, too, all of the problems involved in getting academic geography 'onto the streets' (Fuller and Kitchin, 2004). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {In this study, the authors linked core self-evaluations to job and work success. Utilizing a dynamic design from participants in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79), core self-evaluations were hypothesized to predict individuals' intercepts (starting levels of success), and their growth trajectories (slope of individuals' success over time) with respect to job satisfaction, pay, and occupational status. Results indicated that higher core self-evaluations were associated with both higher initial levels of work success and steeper work success trajectories. Education and health problems that interfere with work mediated a portion of the hypothesized relationships, suggesting that individuals with high core self-evaluations have more ascendant jobs and careers, in part, because they are more apt to pursue further education and maintain better health.},

Such relationships may contain latent competencies with the potential to infuse the dyad with purpose. Meaningful dyadic relationships depend on the dyad's ability to be resilient to within-dyad adversity. Our conceptual analysis examines how interpersonal interactions emerge to dyad-level phenomena in the wake of such adversity. We introduce dyadic resilience, detail the process by which it emerges, identify protective factors and risk factors of dyadic resilience, and posit that the emergence of dyadic resilience influences dyadic thriving over time.},

abstract = {It is clear from recent research studies that art and design higher education has the potential to develop capable, flexible, adaptable, lateral thinking and creative individuals but students do not necessarily recognize these positive outcomes. They also lack essential professional skills and an understanding of the industry they are entering. Yet, this is a growth sector of the economy and people working in the creative industries have shown that they can evolve thriving businesses. This paper explores how these industries work and what the requirements are, what the main concerns are for graduates entering the workplace, and why students find it difficult to make the connection between what they are learning and work. Finally, a student evaluation of the learning outcomes of an assignment focusing on small creative businesses, provides some insights into how students can develop confidence and professional skills, as well as an understanding of how small creative businesses operate.

abstract = {This article provides a narrative review of psychology of entrepreneurship research published in leading psychology journals, based on which we develop an organising framework for future psychological contributions to this field. Furthermore, we introduce the manuscripts collected in this special issue. Our review identified five research areas, broadly corresponding with basic psychological domains, namely personal differences; careers; health and well-being; cognition and behaviour; and leadership; as well as three cross-cutting themes: gender issues; genetic and biological foundations; and context. With the aim to stimulate integration across different approaches and disciplines, we propose a framework to understand how psychologists can offer innovative contributions to the multi-disciplinary entrepreneurship literature. This includes a focus on the entrepreneur embedded in and in interaction with his or her immediate and wider context; attention to different types of entrepreneurs; and a focus on dynamic within-person processes evolving over time.},

The experiences and special challenges of African American women in these settings are the focus of attention and are discussed from the framework of Kanter's theory of proportional representation (Kanter, Men and women of the corporation, New York, NY: Basic Books, ). The tenets of Relational/Cultural theory are applied to illustrate the importance of interpersonal connections in the social work academic environment as well as to provide a framework for the emotional, psychological, social and spiritual consequences of their experiences. Implications for institutional change as well as recommendations are provided to address the interpersonal challenges that African American female social work educators face.

abstract = {Ever since Brown and Levinson's (1978, 1987) seminal work, politeness research in linguistics has been thriving. It is only in the last couple of years, however, that alternative ways of looking at politeness have been investigated in more detail and have gained more followers. This paper aims at explaining one of these ways -- the discursive approach to politeness -- and argues for employing the notion of relational work to move away from a dichotomy between politeness and impoliteness. Instead, it is argued that relational work comprises negatively marked behavior (impoliteness/rudeness), positively marked behavior (politeness), as well as nonmarked, politic behavior which is merely appropriate to the interaction in question and not polite as such. The interactants' assessments of linguistic behavior with respect to norms of appropriateness in social interaction is argued to be at the heart of politeness considerations rather than knowledge of prefabricated inherent linguistic devices. These theoretical considerations are illustrated with a discussion of non-elicited, written data. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

During the past five years, the author has been involved with several projects of relocation. The company he works for and its competitors have thriving offices in South America, Mexico, and the Pacific Rim. These offices are doing most of their business with U.S. companies that are moving manufacturing operations to foreign countries. This is partly due to the much-discussed fact that many manufacturers are looking offshore for cheaper labor. In fact, many people assume that this is the primary reason for the outflow of jobs from the U.S. The technologies used in manufacturing are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly require a work force that is armed with the education and skills to do the job. Some companies are leaving this country because they believe that they can find cheaper high-quality employees in other countries.},

@article{Tomlinson.2016,
abstract = {The goal of this work was to test a theoretical model of relational catalyst (RC) support provision that promotes thriving in non-adverse times. We tested a pathway proposed by Feeney and Collins that explains how RC support in the context of close relationships might lead to thriving. We proposed that once RC support has been received, it functions through the mechanisms of being perceived to be responsive to one's needs and promoting perceived capability. Perceived capability should promote indices of thriving including self-esteem, goal accomplishment, growth, and specific and general availability of support. This model was supported in two studies of married couples using observational and longitudinal methods surrounding the support of goal strivings. Results indicate that (a) partner support of goal strivings predicted important indicators of thriving over time, and (b) both received and perceived RC support work together and play important roles in predicting these outcomes.

Results showed that proactive personality was, only in part, a composite of Big Five facets, which accounted for 26{\%} of its variance. Structural equation modeling results demonstrated that proactive personality, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness predicted motivation to learn. In addition, motivation to learn was positively related to objectively assessed development activity. Proactive personality, extraversion, and openness had significant indirect links to development activity. Hierarchical regression results suggested that proactive personality had significant incremental validity in the prediction of motivation to learn over all relevant Big Five facets.},

abstract = {Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, researchers and practitioners have engaged in a series of efforts to shift health programming with men from being gender-neutral to being more gender-sensitive and gender-transformative. Efforts in this latter category have been increasingly utilised, particularly in the last decade, and attempt to transform gender relations to be more equitable in the name of improved health outcomes for both women and men. We begin by assessing the conceptual progression of social science contributions to gender-transformative health programming with men. Next, we briefly assess the empirical evidence from gender-transformative health interventions with men. Finally, we examine some of the challenges and limitations of gender-transformative health programmes and make recommendations for future work in this thriving interdisciplinary area of study.

Desde la Conferencia Internacional sobre Poblaci{\'{o}}n y Desarrollo de 1994, investigadores y profesionales han aunado esfuerzos para cambiar los programas de salud para hombres desde un enfoque de g{\'{e}}nero neutro hacia uno m{\'{a}}s sensitivo y transformativo. Especialmente en la {\'{u}}ltima d{\'{e}}cada, los esfuerzos en esta {\'{u}}ltima categor{\'{i}}a se han utilizado cada vez m{\'{a}}s para intentar transformar las relaciones de g{\'{e}}nero de forma que sean m{\'{a}}s justas en aras de mejorar los resultados sanitarios tanto para hombres como para mujeres. En primer lugar, evaluamos la progresi{\'{o}}n conceptual de las contribuciones de la ciencia social a los programas sanitarios transformativos de g{\'{e}}nero para hombres. A continuaci{\'{o}}n, valoramos brevemente las pruebas emp{\'{i}}ricas de las intervenciones sanitarias transformativas de g{\'{e}}nero para hombres. Y para terminar, analizamos algunos de los retos y las limitaciones de los programas sanitarios transformativos de g{\'{e}}nero y hacemos recomendaciones para el futuro trabajo en esta floreciente {\'{a}}rea interdisciplinaria de estudio.

abstract = {Despite recognition of the importance of cultural and social diversity in social work education and practice there is a dearth of social work literature related to disability culture. A review of disability studies literature indicates that the disabled people's movement already affirms and celebrates the existence of disability culture as characterized by several agreed upon assumptions: disability culture is cross-cultural; it emerged out of a disability arts movement and its positive portrayal of disabled people; it is not just a shared experience of oppression but includes art, humour, history, evolving language and beliefs, values and strategies for surviving and thriving. Essentialist concepts of culture, as represented in assimilationist and pluralist social work approaches, provide social workers with the false belief that there are cultural competencies that one can develop that are sufficient to become more culturally sensitive. However, analysis of the critical theory underpinning disability culture demonstrates that an understanding of cultural politics is fundamental to social work education if it is to support the work of the disabled people's movement in demystifying and deconstructing the norms, discourses and practices of dominant culture which are represented as neutral and universal.

abstract = {Sweden is considered to be one of the most secular countries when measuring items such as church service attendance, expressed beliefs in God, and agreement with statements such as ``religion is an important part of life,'' compared to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. Official church attendance in major church congregations, such as the Church of Sweden and most other Protestant Free Churches, has shown a pattern of decrease in membership in modern times, with some congregations risking to disappear as a result. New configurations of social work practice are challenging current congregations with crossover-interfaith schemes, shared buildings, and community-oriented services with a field presence in marginalized urban areas, replacing homogeneous and diaconal or charitable work. Three cases of interreligious social work are analyzed, and in particular the social and religious leadership skills required for collaboration between the religious communities as well as the surrounding society. The interreligious social work practice is also an important factor of social service provision in the concerned local communities and has strengthened the role of religion in the social sphere in what can be expressed as a postsecular Sweden.

The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of thriving and its adequacy in describing the experience of well-being among physically frail nursing home residents.

BACKGROUND

There is a lack of theoretical perspectives describing nursing home residents' experience of well-being.

METHOD

The article is based on a literature review and analysis of how the concept of thriving is used in different professional traditions. Three different theoretical perspectives are presented: (1) thriving as an outcome of growth and development; (2) thriving as a psychological state; (3) thriving as an expression of physical health state. In the second part of the paper, the three perspectives are discussed.

CONCLUSION

The authors suggest that there is a need to develop a new concept: that of thriving in physically frail nursing home residents. The article discusses how each of the three theoretical perspectives may contribute to the formation of this concept.},

Beloved husband of 41 years of Doris, devoted father of Elissa, Cheryl, Darlene and Jason, adored Grandfather of Katie, Jake and William, brother of Herbert and Grace, he will be deeply missed by all who had the good fortune to know his quick mind, wit and funny, vivacious spirit.

@article{Benavides.2010,
abstract = {Abstract: Software product line engineering is about producing a set of related products that share more commonalities than variabilities. Feature models are widely used for variability and commonality management in software product lines. Feature models are information models where a set of products are represented as a set of features in a single model. The automated analysis of feature models deals with the computer-aided extraction of information from feature models. The literature on this topic has contributed with a set of operations, techniques, tools and empirical results which have not been surveyed until now. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of feature models 20 years after of their invention. This paper contributes by bringing together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. We also present a conceptual framework to understand the different proposals as well as categorise future contributions. We finally discuss the different studies and propose some challenges to be faced in the future. [Copyright {\&}y{\&} Elsevier]

abstract = {Traditionally, medicine and the social and behavioral sciences have studied health by focusing on pathology. The purpose of this issue of the Journal is to go beyond such a vulnerability model and focus on thriving. We suggest that thriving represents something more than a return to equilibrium following a challenge. This issue describes a {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}value-added{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} model, whereby an individual or community may go beyond survival and recovery from a stressor or illness to thrive. We suggest that this change of focus from illness to health represents a paradigm shift. This article gives an overview of the various ideas featured in this issue, which elaborate empirical and theoretical work on the concept of thriving. Ultimately, we believe that the scientific study of thriving can enhance our understanding of health and provide important opportunities for prevention and intervention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {By using a full panel design in a representative sample of Finnish dentists (N=2555), the present study aimed to test longitudinally the motivational and health impairment processes as proposed in the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model. The second aim was to investigate whether home resources and home demands have an additional influence on both processes over time. The hypotheses were tested with cross-lagged analyses based on two waves over a three-year period. The results supported both the motivational process and the health impairment process. Job resources influenced future work engagement, which, in turn, predicted organizational commitment, whereas job demands predicted burnout over time, which, in turn, predicted future depression. In addition, job resources had a weak negative impact on burnout. Home demands and home resources did not influence the motivational or health impairment process over time. The results support the central role of work characteristics for health and well-being. By integrating both human thriving and ill-health in the same model, the JD-R model may help to bridge the gap between ``negative'' and ``positive'' psychology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

@article{Laszlo.2009,
abstract = {Developments in organizational thinking often lead to new forms of organizational structure. Increases in organizational complexity and operational connectivity have intensified the need for coordinated decision taking at and among all levels of organization. This means that the ability to work in teams has become a core competence in work environments where collaboration is at a premium. Empowered teams consist of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose or a set of performance goals for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. The power and authority traditionally held exclusively by the manager is passed to the team. Contemporary organizations often demonstrate examples of such work teams, showing exceptional job performance and production of innovative solutions. Consequently, there has been great interest in understanding what makes these teams what they are, and how they function. This article reports on the characteristics of high-performance teams found in the study of a particular case and explores the possibilities -- and implications -- for developing high-performance teams into evolutionary learning communities. The significance of this research resides in the focus it lends to advancing beyond the traditional operational benchmark of the high-performance team to a new benchmark identified as the evolutionary learning community. Organizations that embrace this new construct not only raise the bar in terms of team standards for efficient, effective and efficacious operations but also create organizational dynamics that foster quality of work life and business cultures that are vibrant, alive and thriving.

abstract = {This study utilized the two constructs of growth mindset and thriving in college to better understand undergraduate student perceptions, resilience, mindsets, and insights into their experiences and concerns. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of growth mindset workshops on undergraduate students' knowledge and perceptions of their abilities to thrive. This study also sought to determine emerging themes from student perceptions in hopes of shedding some light on how to better support students' persistence to graduation while promoting thriving academically, intrapersonally, and interpersonally. A sample of 86 undergraduate students, ages 18-23, answered a 54-item survey assessing their insights, satisfaction levels about their campus experiences, social interactions, academic experiences, perspective of self, mindsets, and views of thriving. For the qualitative portion of this study, 8 students were interviewed about their insights on growth and fixed mindsets, as well as, their perceptions of thriving in college. A mixed methods approach was implemented in this study to promote a multifaceted concurrent triangulation during the data analysis. Independent sample t-test analysis was conducted on the pre- and post survey data to determine statistical significance of the impact of the five sections of the workshop. Findings from this study indicate that in fact growth mindset workshops have a positive impact on students perceptions of their abilities to thrive, increases their knowledge of growth mindset, and promotes the ability to incorporate meaningful strategies to improve one's mindset. This study begins to bridge the gap between low graduation rates and the role mindsets play in students' abilities to thrive, overcome challenges and setback, learn from mistakes, and utilization of feedback to promote success.},

abstract = {Within the Job Demands-Resources model, the presence of job demands (e.g., work pressure) and the absence of job resources (e.g., social support) relate to burnout through a psychological energetic process, whereas the presence of job resources associates with work engagement through a motivational process. Although various mechanisms have been suggested to understand these processes, empirical evidence for these mechanisms is scarce within the JD-R framework. This study examines the role of basic need satisfaction, as defined within Self-Determination Theory, in the relationships between job demands, job resources, and employees' exhaustion and vigour, the main components of burnout and engagement, respectively. Structural equation modelling in a heterogeneous sample of 745 employees of the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium confirmed that satisfaction of basic psychological needs partially explained the relationships from job demands to exhaustion and from job resources to vigour. It fully accounted for the relationship between job resources and exhaustion. We conclude that the current study adds to the research pointing at need satisfaction as a promising underlying mechanism for employees' thriving at work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {The authors propose that broad aspects of lateral relationships, conceptualized as coworker support and coworker antagonism, are linked to important individual employee outcomes (role perceptions, work attitudes, withdrawal, and effectiveness) in a framework that synthesizes several theoretical predictions. From meta-analytic tests based on 161 independent samples and 77,954 employees, the authors find support for most of the proposed linkages. Alternative explanations are ruled out, as results hold when controlling for leader influences and mediation processes. The authors also observe differential strengths of coworker influence based on its valence, content, and severity, and on the social intensity of the task environment. The authors conclude with a call for more comprehensive, complex theory and investigation of coworker influences as part of the social environment at work.},

abstract = {Mickey Mouse is one of the most recognizable characters in the world, but this famous character will be passing into the public domain when his copyright expires in 2024. The Walt Disney Company also has registered Mickey Mouse as a trademark. Thus, when Mickey passes into the public domain, an interesting conflict between copyright and trademark law will arise, and it is unclear which area of intellectual property law should determine the protections, if any, afforded to Mickey. France's droit d'auteur, or {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}author's rights,{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} offers a possible solution: when an author's exploitation rights expire, the author's moral rights continue to exist indefinitely, protecting the author from potential harmful uses of his or her creation. This scheme is similar to the way trademark law continues to protect trademarks so long as they are used in commerce. By marrying the concepts, trademark law would have a basis to supersede copyright's public domain. Although there would be restrictions to prevent goodwill-damaging uses, the various trademark defenses would remain available to public domain users. Thus, allowing trademark law to govern in the public domain would encourage derivative works and thriving creativity while still protecting goodwill for generations to come. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {Over the past decade work engagement has gained both business and academia attention. With growing number of studies and meta-analyses the concept of work engagement is one of the pillars of positive work and organizational psychology. This systematic review presents the current state of research on work engagement in Poland. Results confirmed that work-engagement studies have not yet reached the threshold to conduct meta-analysis. The review of measurement methods and synthesis of findings allows to identify strengths and gaps in Polish studies. Discussion of limitations and biases in current research is accompanied with urge to overcome them and develop thriving stream of research on work engagement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {BACKGROUND

Positive psychological health is a multifaceted construct and fundamental to individuals' overall mental health. Yet, measures of positive psychological health tend to focus on only a few of these facets. Su, Tay, and Diener () sought to address this by creating the Comprehensive and Brief Inventories of Thriving (CIT/BIT), integrative measures of well-being that assess positive psychological health broadly.

METHOD

Given growing interest in cross-national comparisons in positive psychological health, the present study expands on this work by examining the measurement invariance of these two measures across 10 countries (N = 3,077). First, a series of single-group confirmatory analyses were run to assess how well the CIT/BIT fit data from each country. Next, multi-group confirmatory analyses were run to assess measurement invariance.

RESULTS

Single-group confirmatory factor analysis supported the original 18-factor structure of the CIT when compared to alternative models (single factor, seven factor, bi-factor model) in seven of the 10 countries and the single-factor structure of the BIT across all countries. Results from the measurement invariance analysis indicated partial scalar invariance for the remaining seven countries on the CIT as well as partial scalar invariance across all countries for the BIT.

CONCLUSION

The present study extends the initial work by Su et{\~{}}al. () by providing evidence of the measurement invariance of the comprehensive and brief inventories of thriving across cultures. Although the factor structure of the CIT was inadmissible in three countries, the results provide a crucial first step for those interested in comparing positive psychological health across nations. Research in both using these measures and cross-cultural comparisons on positive psychological health is growing. We hope that the current efforts help facilitate this work towards furthering the understanding of positive psychological health.},

abstract = {This study proposes epistemological and didactic bases to consider literary education as a humanistic social science that encourages cooperative and creative learning of an interdisciplinary nature taking the classics as a starting point. It is part of a hypothesis based on semiotic theories of the hypertext: the educational consideration of literary classics as modern works because its social interest and reference to diverse matters has been thriving along the centuries. It contributes to solve a problem that threatens the current challenge of key competency-based learning: the academic habit of confusing literature with the history of literature and writing with a mere representation of orality, which undermines the heuristic learning inherent in the connective and reflective cognition that encourages interdisciplinary educational practices. Therefore, it proposes a research-action methodology in the classroom that has been validated with numerous interdisciplinary interventions in the stages of primary and secondary education, where literary classics have been matched with authentic contexts by their XXI century readers: children and adolescent create hypertexts which have been gathered in tribute-books which have been analyzed qualitatively. The resulting didactic model is a pioneering teaching reference for interdisciplinary literary education oriented toward a competency-based educational approach comprising task-based learning and projects.

En este estudio se proponen bases epistemol{\'{o}}gicas y did{\'{a}}cticas para considerar la educaci{\'{o}}n literaria como ciencia social humanista que estimula un aprendizaje cooperativo y creativo de proyecci{\'{o}}n interdisciplinar en torno a los cl{\'{a}}sicos. Se parte de una hip{\'{o}}tesis basada en las teor{\'{i}}as semi{\'{o}}ticas del hipertexto: la consideraci{\'{o}}n educativa de los cl{\'{a}}sicos literarios como obras modernas porque a trav{\'{e}}s de los siglos persiste su inter{\'{e}}s social y su convocatoria de ciencias diversas. Contribuye as{\'{i}} a solventar un problema que atenaza al reto actual del aprendizaje basado en competencias b{\'{a}}sicas: la costumbre academicista de confundir la literatura con la historia de la literatura y la escritura con una mera representaci{\'{o}}n de la oralidad, lo cual menoscaba el aprendizaje heur{\'{i}}stico inherente a la cognici{\'{o}}n conectiva y reflexiva que fomenta buenas pr{\'{a}}cticas educativas interdisciplinarias. Por ello, propone una metodolog{\'{i}}a de investigaci{\'{o}}n- acci{\'{o}}n en el aula que ha sido validada con numerosas intervenciones interdisciplinarias en las etapas educativas de Primaria y Secundaria, donde los cl{\'{a}}sicos de la literatura han sido correspondidos desde los contextos aut{\'{e}}nticos de sus lectores del siglo XXI: ni{\~{n}}os y adolescentes creadores de hipertextos reunidos en libros-homenaje que han sido analizados cualitativamente. El modelo did{\'{a}}ctico resultante constituye una referencia pionera sobre educaci{\'{o}}n literaria interdisciplinaria orientada hacia un enfoque educativo basado en competencias desde aprendizajes basados en tareas y en proyectos.

The authors found that supervisors' POS was positively related to their subordinates' perceptions of supervisor support. Subordinates' PSS, in turn, was positively associated with their POS, in-role performance, and extra-role performance. Beyond these bivariate relationships, subordinates' perceptions of support from the supervisor mediated positive relationships of the supervisors' POS with the subordinates' POS and performance. These findings suggest that supervisors who feel supported by the organization reciprocate with more supportive treatment for subordinates.},

''It struck me as the most positive image I'd seen in a long time,'' he said. ''I had to figure out a way to get over there.'' Mr. Abrams, a skater himself, made two trips the following year to photograph what turned out to be a small but thriving skating scene in the war-torn city, in part the work of Skateistan, a school started in 2007 by two Australian skaters. (A documentary about the program, ''Skateistan: To Live and Skate Kabul,'' had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this year.) Overcoming a lack of smooth roads and sidewalks, among other things, Kabul's skaters (girls included) find in skating a rare recreational outlet, Mr. Abrams said. ''The mullahs have no problem with girls skating,'' he said. ''They can't ride a bike, but they can skate. The girls just jump on it.'' ABBY AGUIRRE [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {This study examined the difference in thriving levels in a sample of 346 community college students at one institution compared to the national norms and determined the degree to which peer support contributes to the variance in scores on the Thriving Quotient (Schreiner, 2012). Thriving is defined as full engagement in college experiences on an intellectual, psychological, and interpersonal level and contains 5 subscales of Engaged Learning, Academic Determination, Positive Perspective, Social Connectedness, and Diverse Citizenship (Schreiner, 2010, 2016). One-sample t tests revealed this community college sample was thriving at significantly higher levels than the national 4-year college norms on all subscales of thriving. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of the predictors of overall thriving and scores on each subscale indicated that 48{\%} of the variance in thriving could be explained by the full model, with student-faculty interaction and institutional integrity as the largest contributors to the variance in thriving. As hypothesized, peer support contributed significantly to the variation in thriving, adding a unique 6{\%} to the variation in Thriving Quotient scores after accounting for student demographic characteristics and other campus experiences. Peer support contributed the most to the variance in the Social Connectedness scale (change in R2 = .20) and also significantly to the variance in Engaged Learning and Diverse Citizenship scale scores. Peer support did not contribute significantly to the variance in Academic Determination or Positive Perspective scores, however. Given these findings, implications for practice at community colleges that can aid this population of students to thrive include providing opportunities on campus to develop peer support through peer-to-peer mentoring. Additionally, encouraging positive interactions between faculty and students through a faculty-to-peer mentoring program could allow meaningful processing outside the classroom and provide additional avenues for students to make connections on the community college campus. Finally, institutional integrity can be improved by ensuring the institution communicates clearly, that it sets appropriate expectations, and that faculty and staff interact with students in ways that are congruent with the mission and values of the institution.},

abstract = {In an age obsessed with information sharing, people have become curiously coy about their computing habits. Compelled to commit every detail of our day to Twitter or Facebook, we still want to keep our web browsing and file download history to ourselves. This privacy paradox drives the thriving market for products that claim to either anonymise or completely wipe out records of computer user activity, producing headlines along the way. In an age obsessed with information sharing, people have become curiously coy about their computing habits, and this is driving a thriving market for products that claim to let us work anonymously. A new generation of PC-on-a-stick devices offers users the ability to plug into a computer, run applications and interact with data in a way that leaves precious few clues for administrators and forensic analysts. Jan Collie of Discovery Forensics examines how these devices work and assesses the dangers they pose. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {In the last fifteen years, various projects and publications In the Interconnected areas of theatre studies, theatrical pedagogy, and literary criticism have highlighted associations between theatrical creativity and constructions of age and aging. Despite a thriving {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}theatrical gerontology,{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} the work of contemporary dramatists, especially those outside European and American canons, remains scarcely analyzed. N{\'{u}}ria Casado Gual looks at the dramatic work of Joanna McClelland Glass, a Canadian writer born in 1936 in Saskatoon, and who currently lives in Florida. Despite the recognition that McClelland Glass has received in North American academic and theatrical circles, her plays written between 1984 and the present remain unexamined and a more complete study of her playwriting career is yet to be developed. Through the double lens of cultural gerontology and dramatic criticism, Casado Gual offers an overview of McClelland Glass's theatricalization of old age, based on the main characters and secondary figures that can be associated with this stage of the life course in her work. The composite characterization of McClelland Glass's older figures ensures not only the complexity of the author's portrayal of aging-into- old-age, but also its verisimilitude and, therefore, its meaningfulness. McClelland Glass combines notions of progress and decline in the dramatic depiction of her aged characters, generating an ambivalent narrative of aging that re-presents this essential human experience in a truthful and dignified way. Ultimately, McClelland Glass's recreation of old age is shown to contain the main defining traits of her theatre, as well as the insights that it offers on the complexities and mysteries of the human life course. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]



Au cours des quinze derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es, divers {\'{e}}crits et projets issus des champs connexes que sont les {\'{e}}tudes th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}trales, la p{\'{e}}dagogie du th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}tre et la critique litt{\'{e}}raire ont fait ressortir des associations vari{\'{e}}es entre la cr{\'{e}}ativit{\'{e}} th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}trale et les constructions li{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} l'{\^{a}}ge et au vieillissement. La {\{}$\backslash$flqq{\}} g{\'{e}}rontologie th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}trale {\{}$\backslash$frqq{\}} se porte bien, certes, mais l'{\oe}uvre de dramaturges contemporains, notamment ceux qui sont hors des canons litt{\'{e}}raires europ{\'{e}}ens et am{\'{e}}ricains, reste peu analys{\'{e}}e. Dans cette {\'{e}}tude, N{\'{u}}ria Casado Gual examine les textes de th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}tre de Joanna McClelland Glass, une {\'{e}}crivaine canadienne n{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} Saskatoon en 1936 qui habite aujourd'hui en Floride. Malgr{\'{e}} la reconnaissance {\`{a}} laquelle McClelland Glass a eu droit dans les cercles universitaires et th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}traux en Am{\'{e}}rique du Nord, les pi{\`{e}}ces qu'elle a {\'{e}}crites depuis 1984 n'ont jamais {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} examin{\'{e}}es et l'{\'{e}}tude compl{\`{e}}te de sa carri{\`{e}}re de dramaturge reste {\`{a}} faire. En empruntant la double lentille de la g{\'{e}}rontologie culturelle et de la critique th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}trale, Casado Gual analyse la th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}tralisation de la vieillesse chez McClelland Glass {\`{a}} partir de personnages principaux et secondaires associ{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} ce stade de vie. La caract{\'{e}}risation composite des personnages plus {\^{a}}g{\'{e}}s de McClelland Glass permet de voir non seulement la complexit{\'{e}} du portrait que dresse l'auteure du passage {\`{a}} la vieillesse mais aussi sa vraisemblance et donc sa pertinence. Dans sa repr{\'{e}}sentation dramatique de personnages {\^{a}}g{\'{e}}s, McClelland Glass r{\'{e}}unit les notions de progr{\`{e}}s et de d{\'{e}}clin, cr{\'{e}}ant ainsi un r{\'{e}}cit ambivalent du vieillissement qui re-pr{\'{e}}sente cette exp{\'{e}}rience humaine essentielle d'une mani{\`{e}}re v{\'{e}}ridique et empreinte de dignit{\'{e}}. En fin de compte, la fa{\c{c}}on dont McClelland Glass reproduit la vieillesse contient les principaux traits marquants de son th{\'{e}}{\^{a}}tre et offre une r{\'{e}}flexion sur la complexit{\'{e}} du parcours de vie humain et de ses myst{\`{e}}res.

@article{DagenaisDesmarais.2012,
abstract = {Research on psychological well-being (PWB) in organizational settings is now facing two major challenges. First, conceptual confusion surrounds PWB (Danna and Griffin 1999; Diener 1994; Ryff 1989), and the debate about the superiority of concurrent hedonic, eudaimonic, and integrative approaches is still open. Second, researchers in the organizational sciences mainly study context-free PWB while measuring organizational correlates, despite contextualized non-cognitive measures having proven their incremental validity over context-free measures (e.g. English 2001; Hunthausen et al. 2003). In an attempt to address these issues from a new perspective, an inductive approach was proposed. To confer good content validity to our model of PWB at work (PWBW), a preliminary bottom-up qualitative phase was carried out. On this basis, a quantitative study was conducted. From the 80 manifestations of PWBW obtained, a new instrument was generated and administered to 1,080 workers, supplemented by measures of context-free PWB and distress, of positive and negative affect, and of life satisfaction. Exploratory factor analyses revealed that PWBW can be conceptualized through 5 dimensions, namely, Interpersonal Fit at Work, Thriving at Work, Feeling of Competency at Work, Desire for Involvement at Work, and Perceived Recognition at Work. The questionnaire showed satisfactory internal consistency. Correlational analyses support the 'related but distinct' nature of PWBW with regard to context-free hedonic and eudaimonic PWB dimensions and psychological distress indicators. In sum, the study led to the development of a grounded conceptualization of PWBW based on a work frame-of-reference and tied to a reliable and valid measure.

abstract = {O'Leary (1998) claims that any seemingly intractable challenge holds `the potential for crisis or opportunity' (p. 435). In this article, I draw on a study of seven child care teachers' constructions of their resilience and thriving to consider O'Leary's contention in light of the so-called staffing crisis facing the child care sector in the Australian state of New South Wales. While warning of the dangers of romanticizing teachers and their work, the study suggests that insights into teachers' resilience and thriving may offer productive opportunities for generating alternative cultural scripts of teaching in child care. Cultural scripts or storylines grounded in discourses of agency, freedom, hope, trust, and teaching as intellectual work could assist in repositioning teaching in child care as an attractive career option and thus help to address the current staffing shortage.

abstract = {Subjective perceptions of mental and physical energy were measured by the use of visual analogue scales (VAS) over the course of a week in a group of normal volunteers. These variables were found to correlate, highly both with one another and with assessments of vigour and fatigue measured with a standard adjectival format. In addition, high correlations were found with a measure of positive affect. These five variables also displayed characteristic patterns of diurnal variation. Physical and mental energy, vigour and positive affect were highest in the morning, falling progressively and significantly over the day. In contrast, fatigue showed the opposite pattern. Extraversion showed positive correlations with physical and mental energy, vigour and positive affect, and negative correlations with fatigue and negative affect, most being significant (P less than 0.05). Conversely, neuroticism showed a negative correlation with the first four energy variables but was positively related to fatigue and negative affect, most correlations again being significant. Physical and mental energy, vigour and positive affect also showed a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) with a measure of happiness. It is concluded that VAS-derived ratings of physical and mental energy are reliable indicators of self-perceived vigour and fatigue. They are easy to record and show sufficient short-term stability to be used in more extensive studies both of well-being and of its physiological correlates.},

Social capital, put simply, is the mutual sense of reciprocity and trust which enables groups of people to live and work together successfully. In rich supplies, it fosters a thriving, prosperous society. Recently, there has been a growing, collective awareness that perhaps there is something missing within Australian communities. People have become conscious of what social capital means. When people trust one another and are bound by a sense of mutual obligation, they share an impetus towards common objectives. They form strong social connections and respect similar values. Collective norms, networks and values can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated actions. The resulting social capital becomes a rich resource whereby collective goals and personal satisfaction can be achieved. Ongoing research is raising the awareness of the importance of effectively functioning communities, and their relationship to the overall well-being and prosperity of society at large.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, the use of digital libraries (DLs) has grown significantly. Accordingly, questions about the utility, usability and cost of DLs have started to arise, and greater attention is being paid to the quality evaluation of this type of information system. Since DLs are destined to serve user communities, one of the main aspects to be considered in DL evaluation is the user's opinion. The literature on this topic has produced a set of varied criteria to judge DLs from the user's perspective, measuring instruments to elicit users' opinions, and approaches to analyse the elicited data to conclude an evaluation. This paper provides a literature review of the quality evaluation of DLs based on users' perceptions. Its main contribution is to bring together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. In addition, the various studies are discussed, and some challenges to be faced in the future are proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

A voluminous amount of material was produced concerning attitude structure, attitude change, and the consequences of holding attitudes. In the structure area, particular attention is paid to work on attitude accessibility, ambivalence, and the affective versus cognitive bases of attitudes. In persuasion, our review examines research that has focused on high effort cognitive processes (central route), low effort processes (peripheral route), and the multiple roles by which variables can have an impact on attitudes. Special emphasis is given to work on cognitive dissonance and other biases in message processing, and on the multiple processes by which mood influences evaluations. Work on the consequences of attitudes focuses on the impact of attitudes on behavior and social judgments.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the effect of team feedback environment on feedback-seeking behavior, and further explored how feedback-seeking behavior led to the feeling of thriving at work and team commitment. Also, we examined the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between team feedback environment and feedback-seeking behavior. Using survey data from 201 workers employed in various industries in Korea, we found that team feedback environment was positively related to feedback-seeking behavior, and that the relationship was moderated by self-efficacy. In addition, feedback-seeking behavior was positively associated with the feeling of thriving at work and team commitment. The result suggests the importance of feedback-seeking behavior in improving performance as well as work attitude and energy. The result also emphasizes the critical role that team feedback environment plays, and the need to find ways to nurture the environment that fosters feedback seeking and giving.

abstract = {THE American Community Survey may be the most important government function you've never heard of, and it's in trouble. This survey of American households has been around in some form since 1850, either as a longer version of or a richer supplement to the basic decennial census. It tells Americans how poor we are, how rich we are, who is suffering, who is thriving, where people work, what kind of training people need to get jobs, what languages people speak, who uses food stamps, who has access to health care, and so on.

abstract = {Several quantitative reviews have documented the negative relationships that role stressors have with task performance. Surprisingly, much less attention has been directed at the impact of role stressors on other aspects of job performance, such as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). The goal of this study was to therefore estimate the overall relationships of role stressors (i.e., role ambiguity, conflict, and overload) with OCB. A meta-analysis of 42 existing studies indicated that role ambiguity and role conflict were negatively related to OCB and that these relationships were moderated by the target of OCB, type of organization, OCB rating source, and publication status. As expected, role conflict had a stronger negative relationship with OCB than it did with task performance. Finally, we found support for a path model in which job satisfaction mediated relationships of role stressors with OCB and for a positive direct relationship between role overload and OCB.},

abstract = {We should be inventing new connections between artistic activity and a range of other human activities through the construction of a democratic public space, outside of the traditional spaces for art; a zone of `indistinction' of life and art, that allows a knowledge exchange, and where collectivity and commitment can be reaffirmed. In this article I analyse my practice as the director of the Festival Belluard Bollwerk International, in Fribourg, Switzerland, from 2007 to 2013. How can an art festival function as an interface between art and everyday life, as an agora? I draw on the work of Jean Ranci{\`{e}}re to argue that we were thriving in a zone of indistinction of life and art, where the agency of the art projects we produced consisted within their presence and their disturbance of the everyday, rather than in making concrete political or social claims. Furthermore, the subject of community in artistic practice is developed in relation to useful art and the exchange of knowledge in an emancipated way. The ideas presented will be illustrated with different art projects produced at the Belluard Festival. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {Quid pro quo (QPQ) sexual harassment, in which sexual compliance is tied to some consequent behavior of the harassing party, can involve two types of social interactions: social exchanges or threats. Two experiments (N = 260) evaluated how QPQ sexual harassment statements were perceived as different types of social interactions due to the manipulation of three variables. Statements were predicted and found to be perceived differently across how they were posed (positive versus negative value statements), across surrounding work contexts (thriving versus failing), and across sex of the harassed perceiver. These differing perceptions also affected subsequent behaviors in reasoning about the harassment situation. Implications of these results are discussed, along with limitations and future research directions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Health care workers (N = 1,173, Time 1; N = 907, Time 2) working in 41 units completed a survey of social relationships, burnout, turnover intention, attitudes, and management trust before and after a 6-month intervention, CREW (Civility, Respect, and Engagement at Work). Most measures significantly improved for the 8 intervention units, and these improvements were significantly greater than changes in the 33 contrast units. Specifically, significant interactions indicating greater improvements in the intervention groups than in the contrast groups were found for coworker civility, supervisor incivility, respect, cynicism, job satisfaction, management trust, and absences. Improvements in civility mediated improvements in attitudes. The results suggest that this employee-based civility intervention can improve collegiality and enhance health care provider outcomes.},

@article{Dunn.2013,
abstract = {This article argues that work ethic research has suffered from a tendency to conflate preference and morality, and that this has been particularly detrimental to our understanding of the relationship between commitment to the work ethic and educational attainment. The work ethic is almost always measured quantitatively, yet in-depth research offers a fuller understanding of individuals' moral beliefs and motivations, and it can provide possible explanations for the very different results established by the various quantitative measures. Findings from 50 in-depth interviews offered support to those who claim that work morality is largely a `wealth ethic' -- about not being dependent upon state benefits. Education strongly influenced moral beliefs. Crucially, while the more educated were the least likely to moralise in favour of work or the `wealth ethic' and most disliked lower status employment, they could expect to score highly on measures of the work ethic that emphasise preference rather than morality because their education usually secured them enjoyable `career' jobs. Furthermore, the fact that preferences play such an important part in work ethic measurement might help explain the discrepancy between theoretical claims of a declining work ethic and empirical studies which demonstrate that it is thriving.

abstract = {In Australia, clubs have long been viewed by some sections of the hospitality industry as the `poor cousins' of the more glamorous end of the market, such as four- and five-star hotels and resorts. Despite this perception, clubs are continuing to experience growth both in terms of membership and revenues collected and many play significant roles within the communities in which they operate. With regard to special events, much of the economic and social impact work published to date has focused upon the impact of such events in terms of accommodation and restaurant use, as well as visitor numbers and economic multipliers. The club industry in Australia, and in New South Wales (NSW) in particular, is a vibrant and thriving industry, but little work has been carried out to quantify the impact upon clubs of `outside' or external special events. Using in-depth interviews and discussions with marketing staff within two clubs in NSW (one rural and one metropolitan), this article examines their relationships to hallmark events that were conducted within each club's region. Analysis is made of the clubs' involvement with these events and the extent to which they were aggressively proactive in acquiring linkages to the event in question. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Selye's concept of eustress or "good stress" appears to be largely ignored in the literature, while the Yerkes Dodson Law is illustrated as a model for management practice. We suggest that the meaning assigned to the word stress has shifted from Selye's original formulation, and that this shift, in conjunction with the use of the Yerkes Dodson Law leads to inappropriate management of stress in organizations. We conclude that the concept that some stress is good and enhances performance should be rejected in favour of more useful and accurate concepts.},

abstract = {This article presents four steps to being more efficient in the work place according to Julie Morgenstern, professional organizer extraordinaire and author of {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}Making Work Work.{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} 1. Do Big Stuff First. Look at the tasks you have to accomplish each day and segregate them into big ones and small ones. Write a cover story: big. File expense report: small. The trouble is, most of us are inclined to knock off the small items first, figuring we'll get at least some feeling of accomplishment. But, says Morgenstern, it doesn't work that way .2. Turn Off E-mail for the First 60 Minutes. I have to admit that I thought this was a joke. Wrong. Being swept up by e-mail as soon as you hit the office and pull the lid off your coffee is unnatural. Morgenstern's solution is no e-mail for the first hour of the day. 3. Stop Multi-tasking. During the '80s and '90s, we thought that the way to become more efficient was to do many things at once. Today, studies have found the opposite. If you stop working on a particular task and pick it up later, your brain needs 15 minutes to get back to where you left off. By stopping and starting, you're losing hours a day. 4{\textgreater}Leave Work 30 Minutes Early. Think about how you work on a typical day. Now think about how you work when you're on a deadline. You don't procrastinate. You're more effective. {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}Leaving work a half-hour early makes you work as if you're on a deadline all the time,{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} Morgenstern explains. And what do you do with that extra half-hour? Something {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}restorative{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} that will let you go back to your routine refreshed the next day.},

abstract = {THERE are all kinds of products out there that are supposed to boost your brainpower. Right now, for example, I am wired into a device called the MC Square, which is apparently used by millions of Korean students while studying for their college entrance exams. It's sending a continuous stream of dolphin noises into my ears, along with a droning techno beat, and it works, as far as I can tell, on the principle that whatever is extremely annoying must be good for you. But to judge from a number of new brain books, like ''Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home and School'' and ''Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life,'' probably the best thing you can do for your brain is exercise, maybe play a video game and then take a nap. (As it happens, there's also a sleep setting on the MC Square, except that in my experience, it tends to keep you awake.) [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

abstract = {We examine the concepts of stress, distress, and eustress and develop three tenets that are used to relate these concepts to three major theories or models of occupational stress. Selye's concept of eustress or "good stress" appears to be largely ignored in the literature, while the Yerkes Dodson Law is illustrated as a model for management practice. We suggest that the meaning assigned to the word stress has shifted from Selye's original formulation, and that this shift, in conjunction with the use of the Yerkes Dodson Law leads to inappropriate management of stress in organizations. We conclude that the concept that some stress is good and enhances performance should be rejected in favour of more useful and accurate concepts.},

POM (Petra/Osiris/Molinspiration) was carried out to get insight into requirements that can lead to the improvement of the activity of these molecules. The CoMSIA model, based on a combination of steric, electrostatic and H-bond acceptor/donor effects, is with R 2cv =0.738 and R 2 =0.911. The analyses reveal that lipophilicity, hydrogen donor/acceptor and steric factors play crucial role. The study with constructive propositions could be useful for the design of new analogues with enhanced activity. [Copyright {\&}y{\&} Elsevier]

abstract = {The nineteenth century was a time when British culture, although increasingly insular in many ways, was also increasingly aware of a wide spread of world literature. New ``discoveries'' included writing from Germany, Northern and Eastern Europe, medieval Spain and the countries of the East. An important part in this exploration was played by the thriving new periodical literature, which found space both for translations of foreign works and for long reviews that often contained substantial translated passages. This field has yet to be fully explored; the present article focuses on two very different Edinburgh periodicals which occupied a central position in British literary culture, the Edinburgh Review and Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. An analysis of the content of these journals over two five-year periods during the first half of the century brings out the different approaches of an established review and a newly founded magazine, showing among other things Blackwood's interest in a great variety of foreign writing, ancient and modern, (above all from Germany) and in the process of translation, while the Edinburgh Review tends to concentrate on recent French culture.

abstract = {Boundary perturbations are considered as flow control forcing and their distributions are optimised to suppress transient energy growth induced by the most energetic disturbances in the domain. For a given control cost (square integration of the control forcing), the optimal control calculated from the proposed optimisation algorithm is proved to be unique. For small values of control cost, a sensitivity solution is obtained and its distribution indicates the sensitivity of perturbation energy on boundary control. For larger control cost, the distribution of the optimal control approaches the stablest mode of a direct-adjoint operator and tends to be grid-to-grid oscillatory. A controllability analysis is further conducted to identify the uncontrollable component of perturbations in the domain. This work underpins the recently thriving linear feed-back flow control investigations, most of which use empirically distributed control actuators, in terms of choosing the location and magnitude of the control forcing and evaluating the maximum control effect. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed algorithm; in a stenotic flow, the optimised wall boundary control is observed to suppress over 95{\%} of the transient energy growth induced by the global optimal initial perturbation; in the Batchelor vortex flow, the optimal inflow control can effectively suppress the spiral vortex breakdown induced by the development of initial perturbations.

To be concrete, by concentrating on some of the well-known policy-related works conducted by three thriving research programs in experimental economics, this paper demonstrates what kinds of perspectives contemporary experimental economists take towards a foundational issue in economics, rationality. The disunity this paper finds in experimental economists' practices is interpreted as a source of strength, rather than weakness, for experimental economics as a whole. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

@article{Tuinstra.2004,
abstract = {This article discusses the impact of the Internet on the coverage of foreign news. According to Graham Earnshaw, editor in chief of Xinhua Finance News (XFN), the Internet made it possible for others, including XFN, to do the same kind of news gathering at a lesser cost. Since 2000, the Internet has developed into the dominant information provider for academics, the international business community and journalists in China. One reason for this is that getting print media sent from outside of China requires its recipient to pay a heavy import surcharge to the Chinese monopoly in charge of bringing them into the country. Censorship of Web sites, by the government, has also been easy to circumvent. These changes were happening at the same time the number of foreign correspondents in Shanghai, the largest and most thriving city in China, did not go up substantially, and the resources they had to do their jobs were declining. Interest in publishing what foreign correspondents have to report is falling, too. In Europe, it seems that only the Financial Times has the clout necessary to keep its foreign operations thriving. The work done by foreign correspondents is now also in the forefront of changes triggered by the proliferation of the Internet. In the September 2003 issue of Foreign Affairs, John Maxwell Hamilton writes about Weblogs as presenting a possible alternative for the classic arrangement of foreign correspondence. In places like Iran and Iraq, some bloggers have shown how the Internet can be a powerful tool in providing the kind of frontline information that traditional news media aren't able to obtain. What hampers development in this direction is finding ways to commercially finance this kind of reporting, information gathering, and dissemination.

@article{Ferguson.2005,
abstract = {This article focuses on radio personality Kate Aiken. Bob Hortop found his future mother-in-law intimidating when he first met her in 1946 -- although not for the usual reasons. She was Kate Aitken. On three daily radio shows over three decades, in the pages of the Montreal Standard during the 1940s and as a cooking-school and fashion-show host in cities across the country, Canada's doyenne of domesticity ruled good-naturedly, yet firmly, on everything from keeping fruitcakes moist to refashioning worn-out clothes. The Beeton, Ont., shopkeeper's daughter first gained fame in the early 1920s for her thriving poultry farm and canning business, as well as for her work in the local Women's Institute, which she helped found. Never questioning a woman's duty to her husband and family, Aitken -- who died in 1971 at age 81 -- wouldn't pass muster with everyone celebrating International Women's Day this March 8. Aitken launched her radio career literally by accident. Her later broadcasts usually led with cooking tips, but quickly moved on to more serious fare, treating her audience to firsthand accounts of a 1938 speech by Hitler in Berlin, Hungarian refugees fleeing their strife-torn country in 1956 and countless other newsmaking events. Despite shuttling between Montreal and Toronto weekly, Aitken found time to oversee her farm's annual production of 12,000 jars of preserves, launch 43 {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}remake centres{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} across Canada as wartime supervisor of clothing conservation, and write seven books. Aitken's strength of character, according to son-in-law Hortop, had little to do with being a feminist.},
